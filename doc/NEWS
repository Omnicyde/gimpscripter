This is the new version of the "Make Shortcut" plugin for Gimp.  It is now called "Gimpscripter."  It lets you point-and-click to create a plugin that calls a sequence of other plugins or PDB procedures or macros (common sequences of calls.)

The differences from the prior version:

- a sequence of calls instead of just one call
- call any PDB procedure, not just plugins
- call macros that more closely match Gimp menu semantics than the PDB does 
  (e.g. Channel/New, which also attaches the channel)
- call macros for common sequences (e.g. Display/New, also flushes)
- call macros that better define parameter types (e.g. Context/Set/Choose brush)
- lets you enter parameters for the called procedures
- OR lets you defer parameters for called procedures until runtime

See the TODO file for deficiencies.
