Here are some of the deficiencies:

- defaults for settings are lame (because the PDB does not keep them)
- range checking for settings is non-existent (because the PDB does not keep them)
- mock menu items are missing (file map_procedures.py is incomplete)
- macros are missing (file macros.py is incomplete)
- the GUI could be more user friendly
- the look and feel should match the Gimp style and might need to use the user's theme
- should allow user to insert and remove commands from a sequence
- should allow user to enter the blurb for a wrapper plugin
- lightly tested.  Testing should be automated.
- let user choose a menu for the wrapper, not just "Shortcut>"
- check the return value of wrapped procedures and raise, if error returns can be determined
- substitute our own blurb for mockmenu items that have new semantics via the GS stack model

These are some Gimp quirks that macros address, and that might go away:
- the floating selection
- creating layers that are not attached to an image
- inconvenient (for users) parameter units, such as pixels instead of percent for scaling
- declared type of parameters for many procedures is too generic, e.g. string for brush
